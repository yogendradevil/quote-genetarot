Title: Random Quote Generator using API

Description: Random Quote Generator is a mini project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app fetches random quotes from an external API and displays them in a user-friendly interface. The user can also click a button to generate a new random quote.

This project showcases my skills in web development, particularly in working with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as in integrating external APIs into my projects. Through this project, I learned how to work with APIs to fetch data and manipulate it in real-time to provide a dynamic user experience. The code is open-source and available on GitHub, allowing others to view and learn from my implementation.
